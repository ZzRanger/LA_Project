          <p class="about-text">
            The great American classic <i> The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn </i> is widely interpreted as a satire of Southern society. A critical component of this satire in Mark Twain's novel
			is the hypocritical behavior many characters in the book display.
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            There are many instances of various characters in the book acting hypocritically (i.e. Widow, Pap, King & Duke, Grangerfords & Sheperdsons). Twain did this primarily to <b> criticize the norms
			and beliefs held by those in Southern society. </b>
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            The instances of hypocrisy in the book can be broken down into three main categories: racial hypocrisy, moral hypocrisy, and religious hypocrisy.

	Ironically, both families brought their guns to church and kept them between their laps throughout the whole sermon. Twain included this scene in the book to criticize those in Southern society who claim
	to be religious but disregard many of its teachings to fit their on worldview.</span>

    At the beginning of the book, Huck was adopted by the Widow Douglas, who wanted to 'sivilize' him. One day, the Widow got upset at Huck for asking to smoke a cigar, as she saw it as immoral. Ironically,
		  the Widow used tabacco (which arguably has the same stigma as cigars) and said that was okay to use it since she used it herself. This instance of hypocrisy demonstrates the double standards many people
		  in society have regarding ethics and morality. Furthermore, it illustrates a "fear of the unknown" mentality prevalent in Southern society.

          <div class = "new"> The characters in the book each represent a certain sterotype in Southern society. 
  By having instances of hypocrisy among many distinct characters in the book, Twain was able to criticize Southern society in totality,
  particularly condemning systemic raical bias against African Americans, lack of sincerity in upholding religious principles, and double 
  standards for morality.
